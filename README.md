This website is super cute and well designed, I really like it! The colors are super nice and the layout in general is super nice too. It's a really nice and professional looking website I love it. 

The Home menu about us image is weirdly stretched out though, so maybe try and crop it to fit the frame better. 
On the "Browse our Menu" page, the very last button is barely visible and can't be scrolled down on. There's also an empty pink bar on the side which I assume is overflow on the page. 
This isn't a bug, but it would be nice to have a button to return to the top of the page so the user doesn't have to scroll so much to return to the navbar.

- 1/3 : Established who would do what pages; started the basic structure of each page, managed to get the navbar done as well
- 1/4 : Finished majority of the desktop version for each page; Got the sticky sidebar to work with JS, footer was also done
- 1/5 : Responsiveness for Home, Menu, and Review Page was done; Contact Page Desktop was finished
- 1/6 : Touched up on a lot of litte things; Issues with the navbar and the carousel but found a solution; responsiveness for contact's page was done; Added the title/header for review page 

fixes:
1/6 : fixed stretched image (sinatha)
